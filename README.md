**Project Description:**  
Serverless ETL pipeline for Spotify analytics leveraging AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, Snowpipe, and Snowflake, with Power BI dashboards for near real-time data insights.

## Overview

This project implements a **serverless ETL pipeline** to extract data from the Spotify API, transform it, and load it into Snowflake for advanced analytics and visualization using Power BI.

The goal is to enable **near real-time insights** on Spotify streaming data by leveraging modern cloud-native services with automated orchestration and scaling.

## Architecture Workflow

### Extract (Spotify API â†’ AWS Lambda â†’ S3)

- Extracts data from Spotify API using Python and the Spotipy package.
- AWS Lambda (Extraction Function) is triggered by Amazon CloudWatch on a **daily schedule**.
- Extracted raw data is stored in **Amazon S3** as JSON files.

### Transform (AWS Lambda â†’ S3)

- An **S3 Object PUT event** triggers a second AWS Lambda (Transformation Function).
- The Lambda performs necessary data cleaning, normalization, and transformation.
- Transformed data is written back to S3 in a **separate folder** ready for loading.

### Load & Analyze (Snowpipe â†’ Snowflake â†’ Power BI)

- **Snowpipe** continuously ingests transformed data from S3 into **Snowflake**.
- Data is modeled within Snowflake using **SQL-based transformations**.
- **Power BI** connects live to Snowflake to visualize Spotify analytics dashboards.

## Technologies Used

- **Spotify API** â†’ Data source for streaming and metadata.
- **Python** â†’ Used in AWS Lambda for Extraction and Transformation.
- **AWS Lambda** â†’ Serverless compute to automate ETL logic.
- **Amazon CloudWatch** â†’ Scheduling Lambda extraction functions.
- **Amazon S3** â†’ Storage of raw and transformed data.
- **S3 Trigger** â†’ Event-driven transformation process.
- **Snowpipe** â†’ Continuous, automated data loading into Snowflake.
- **Snowflake** â†’ Cloud Data Warehouse for scalable analytics.
- **Power BI** â†’ Visualization layer for creating dashboards and reports.

## Automation

- AWS CloudWatch triggers periodic **Spotify data extraction**.
- S3 Object PUT event triggers **automatic data transformation**.
- Snowpipe **auto-ingests transformed data** to Snowflake without manual intervention.
- **Power BI dashboards** are connected to live Snowflake views for always up-to-date insights.

## Setup & Deployment

1. **Obtain Spotify API credentials** (Client ID & Secret) and configure Spotipy in Lambda.
2. **Deploy AWS Lambda Functions**:
    - Extraction Lambda â†’ Fetches Spotify data, writes raw JSON to S3.
    - Transformation Lambda â†’ Cleans/transforms data, writes to a separate S3 folder.
3. **Configure Amazon CloudWatch** to trigger Extraction Lambda daily/weekly.
4. **Enable S3 PUT Trigger** to invoke the Transformation Lambda.
5. **Configure Snowpipe** to monitor the transformed data S3 path and auto-load data into Snowflake.
6. **Connect Power BI** to Snowflake using Snowflake Connector â†’ Build interactive dashboards.

## Usage

- **Extract** Spotify data â†’ Stored in S3 (Raw).
- **Transform** data using Lambda â†’ Stored in S3 (Transformed).
- **Load** transformed data into Snowflake via Snowpipe.
- **Visualize** Spotify analytics in Power BI dashboards.

Example Use Cases:
- Daily/weekly Spotify stream trends.
- Artist/track popularity over time.
- Playlist analytics.
- Audience insights by geography.

## Final Note

This architecture provides a **modern, fully automated, serverless, and scalable ETL pipeline** for near real-time Spotify data analytics using AWS and Snowflake.

It demonstrates key data engineering concepts:
- Serverless orchestration
- Event-driven pipelines
- Continuous data ingestion
- Cloud-native data warehousing
- Business analytics and visualization.
